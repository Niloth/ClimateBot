# ClimateBot
Project1: Climate Bot based on Google DialogFlow integrated with Telegram App

# Purpose :
Climate change refers to long-term shifts in weather patterns and global temperatures, primarily caused by human activities such as burning fossil fuels and deforestation. It poses a significant threat to the planet and its inhabitants, including increased frequency of extreme weather events, rising sea levels, loss of biodiversity, and disruptions to ecosystems. Educating people about climate change is of utmost importance as it raises awareness and empowers individuals to take action towards mitigating its impacts. By understanding the causes, consequences, and potential solutions to climate change, people can make informed choices and adopt sustainable practices that reduce greenhouse gas emissions and promote environmental stewardship
